(In no-file-test branch)-

1. The value of "serial" as incremented by the "directory_chooser" variable is not preserved when piped to the "column" command.
    This does not happen when the directory_chooser on line 186 is not piped to column. 
    
    The value of serial not getting updated causes the else statement on line 204 to get executed since the condition on line 195 is always false.
